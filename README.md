# ValorantTools [WIP]
Python project that uses the official API for Valorant to authenticate the player, and get valuable info like the ranks of teammates in lobby, the current shop rotation, and teammate loadouts. The sample output that I get from calling the get_match endpoint is in sample_output.json. I then parse this and call another endpoint to grab usernames and then show the stats to the user. 

## Todo
Add Tkinkter GUI
Add more functions from the API
Bundle into .exe
